    "This is a data set of payment information provided by New York companies in the public sector. According to the Kaggle page, these companies are legally required to provide this data in accordance with Section 2800 of Public Authorities Law. It includes various types of payment such as salary, overtime, performance, extra forms of compensation, etc. The payment information is divided between five industrial categories, operational, administrative and clerical, technical and engineering, professional, managerial, and executive. It also has more defining items for the individual employees such as if they are full or part time or paid by the state government for their work, not a company.  \n",

    "The goal of my data analytics is to determine how much and in what ways an employee should be compensated based on his or her category and full time status in the public sector of New York. This information would be helpful for both companies and employees in the public and private sector. For companies in the public sector, this data would inform them what they have to pay various working categories to stay competitive, that is offer comparable pay to the rest of that industry. Likewise, for employees, this data would inform them based on their group and full time status if they are being paid at competitive level at their current job. This is especially helpful because discussing salary among or between employees is considered taboo in the workforce. This can leave employees comparative sense of how much they are being paid relative to the industry. It would also inform private sector companies how much they must be willing to pay various groups to convince them to transition over from public to private sector work, or how much they must pay their own employees to stop the inverse transition from happening. Similarly, this informs private sector employees of an average comparable salary if they transitioned into the public sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the success of my algorithm, we would need further data. According to a Retensa, a company focused on improving the retention rates at companies, 64% of public sector industry leaders across the country have issues with retention. Assuming this as the average, companies in New York could adjust their pay according to my analysis. After this we could survey companies and see if the amount of companies fearing employee turnover is less than the average provided by Reensa. If it is, we could assume my payment rates are competitive enough to encourage the majority of employees to stay.  \n",

    "So we can see, most data is shoved into a simple non null object and there appears to be a huge amount of missing data, sometimes as many as 2046 entries missing. Let’s see if we cannot make this data a little cleaner and more usable. First, we can remove any row that has a “Y” value for “Paid by Another Entity” or “Paid by State or Local Government.” This data is valid and important, but since we are concerned with how public sector businesses compensate their employees, we do not care about employees that are not compensated by their business. We can also remove any row of data that has a “N” in the “Has Employees” column. If there is no \"N\" we assume the data has been provided for that row. These business do not have to report their information to the state of New York and therefore have no data tied to them. The lack of any other data tied to company makes imputing unknown data difficult and likely ineffective due to the large amount of data needed to be imputed. They also according to the kaggle page, represent only 5% of the data of this set, and thus can be safely ignored.    \n"

We can also remove any data involving names such as “Last Name”, “Middle Initial”, “First Name”, \"Title\", and “Authority Name”. Since we are not focusing on specific people or companies but rather groups, this information is unnecessary. We can also remove “Department.” While this value would be helpful in grouping employees by career, we already have the much better column “Group” for that. Group is better because it is standardized for the data set, not just a string value assigned by the employer. “Group” is also far more present, having no missing entries, relative to the “Department” column’s 1131 missing entries. The \"Exempt Indicator\" can also be removed. This column has to do with labor laws and is not relevant to our question.\n"
