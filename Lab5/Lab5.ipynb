    "Our data set for this lab is a collection of synthetic online transactions produced by The PaySim simulator and collected by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The simulation was created based on real financial data for a multinational company. It is categorized by the type of the transaction (i.e. a payment, transfer, etc.), the original balance before and after the transaction of the source account, the balance before and after the transaction of the destination account, and if the transaction was actually fraud. It is also marked by several other categories not useful for this use case. As more and more transactions shift from the physical space to the digital space, it becomes more important for financial institutions to be able to detect and deny fraudulent charges. As the number of digital transactions increases, the amount of data to parse to determine the legitimacy of a transaction increases to the point where these companies could not afford humans to do the fraud detection. This is where our model would come in, as an efficient learning tool able to detect and mark fraud for these institutions. Romexsoft, a company that helps develop fraud detection models, boast a 98% fraud detection rate. For our model to be a success, it must detect at or above this rate. \n",

If scammers found a method to execute a certain kind of transaction on customer accounts, they would use the same transaction type over and over to extract money from a customer account into their own.  Next we will cross Org_Account_Delta and type. This will help us establish the same kind of correlation from the previous column cross. It will however also reveal to us possible correlations where scammers are directly drawing from customer accounts without using a secondary account. Logically scammers would try this method as much as possible, as it does not involve adding a secondary account with a paper trail that could possibly lead back to them. If these kinds of fraudulent transactions are common, this cross will reveal it. Finally, we will cross Dest_Account_Delta and Org_Account_Delta. This will help further learn the correlation between when money leaves a customer account and ends up in a new account. Untimely this will help further cement either the correlation between a high number of direct fraudulent withdraws, or fraudulent money transfers.     \n",

In this instance a false negative means marking a fraudulent transaction as a genuine one. A false positive means we have marked a genuine transaction as a fraudulent one. In a false positive scenario, the client may be slightly inconvenienced. He would have to call the bank and ensure the proper funds are released. In a false negative situation, the clientâ€™s money has been illegally transferred from his account and is most likely lost to him forever. The bank will have to spend time both reimbursing his account and filing the proper paperwork about the fraudulent attempt. The client will be unhappy the bank has not properly secured his money and the criminal has just successful conned the bank. In order to prevent what would be the worse case scenario for a mislabeled transaction, we will focus on keeping our recall and subsequently our false negative rate low.\n"

    "For our data, we will use a stratified shuffle split. The stratification of the data ensures that each k-fold will have the same percentage of fraudulent data as the data set as a whole. This prevents the model from ever receiving and being trained off of a data set with no fraudulent transactions present. If this were the case, our network may simply detect everything as genuine and still have a good evaluation score. shuffling will prevent any one account from being disproportionally present in a fold. As this data was originally linear time data, it is possible one account would be making several hundreds of transactions sequentially. For instance, a company may be restocking all its inventory at once. To avoid this, we will shuffle the data. While 10 splits would have been the best choice, for the sake of computation, we will bound it with 5 folds. \n"
